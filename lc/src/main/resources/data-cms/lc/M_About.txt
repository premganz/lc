<p class="MsoNormal">This is the Leafy Campus Organization.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is one of those organizaitons that is started to make an impact in the world and to change the world for better. &nbsp;But that is easier said than done, after all the trick of the problem is that one has hardly any clue where to start first. There are quite some non governmental agencies already busy with some of the pressing problems and making good progress in there as well. There are businesses that try to generate employment and better the distribution situation of the planet. While lot of headway had been made and we happen to live in the peaefullest time in human history and by and large we have enough to feed ourselves and reasonable protection from diseases and dangers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But this is not the time to end the reforms carried out, the most significant of this could be counted in modern public instruction. Many of the problems that appear complex could be plotted to some kind of human weakness making it appear indestructable and elusive for scientific solutions. May of the problems could be traced to seemingly innocent issues in childhood such as confusion, ignorance and insecurity. &nbsp;The poor kids that cannot see that there is no need to assert superiority in order to be secure as there is enough to go around in the world if everyone cooperates in good will ends up becoming anything from a hoarder to an manipulative lobbying businessman to a corrupt politician depending on the circumstances. The one that is confused about the way the way knowledge empowers people to come together over clear understanding and limit chaos may slip into poverty. But even more common is the case of the kid that spends all the time stuffing raw facts into his head that he finds little time to reflect and make sense of his education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But did we not spend a decade and half preparing every person going to be part of the society instructing them the best ways to live here and conduct their economic and social lives. If it makes sense to try and solve the problems as up-stream as possible, then the school and college campus would be where to look at.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That&rsquo;s what we would be doing. We would be a dynamic evolving organizaiton. At this point we are a simple organizaiton, but we are looking at ways to grow either as a funded organization with clear priorities and plans or ones that can generate revenue and become some kind of lifestyle company like the way shown by Liferay Gmbh. But that&rsquo;s a long way into the future, at this point, we want to broadcast to the world some good ideas about improving the education system. To be more particular, we would not try to shake the the main curriculum that had been prescribed by Governments after a lot of research, but rather we will work in paralell. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The parlell line would be one of trying to address the problems of confusion directly, we could see most of the problems causing confusion has to do with the lack of explicitnes in the instruction manuals. While a physics book may define the equations of velocity, the mapping of the equations to real life metro rail system that has a higher velocity when it comes to moving from start to destination inspite of lesser abolute speed vis a vis private trasnportation can help getting the meaning of being educated in the laws of phsyics and not merely knowledgeable thereof. That&rsquo;s &nbsp;only a very weak example, the impact of meaningful education that which maps every bit of instruction to the scheme of things-should-be in an ideal world populated by educated citiizens could be dramatic. Then automatically the water tightness between disciplines would have to yield too and connect to one meaningful body of wisdom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We would concentrate on creating documents in text and visual media to get across some sample explanations and post it here in this site. We would also try to do some direct grassroots attempts to access kids in formative years and provide this kind of instruction and record some outcomes here.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This way we would like to popularize this organization on this web platform and make a place to express our views and a place where people can contact us and colloborate with us. You can see more stuff coming up here in the days to come.</p>
