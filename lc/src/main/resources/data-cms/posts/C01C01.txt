<p>Defining Liberal Education is not simple. It is like describing the Angel Falls, you can say enough of how the falls thunder from lofty mountains,&nbsp;how the spray was blinding and the deafening grandeur with which it stood&nbsp;as an imposing reminder of the might of nature in its savageness. One can go about prosaically, but one can never adequately capture the moment of wonderment one feels in his guts at the sight of it. Thats the way with liberal education, we try to paint simple pictures of one of the greatest thoughts of mankind, hoping to adequeately stir the souls of the readers in the hope of enticing them to visit for themselves and find out. Thus would be my venture too.</p>

<p>I would rather not repeat the job, that the learned people from the AACU had already done. You can find it in the link here. In breifer terms, it is just what education had always been, except in very recent times. Liberal education is actually getting an education, rather than learning subjects. When some one is exposed to liberal education, mind not instructed in , not taught, but only exposed to an atmosphere of liberal education, he attends classes in order to appreciate the view point of teachers on fields of knowledge, discuss with their class mates , experiments and thinks by himself to discover knowledge. He undergoes an enriching experience of gaining wisdom and knowledge on fields all the time grounded to the need of such knowledge for humanity and learns to appreciate the aesthetics of a well rounded knowledge, expressing such appreciation through spirited intellectual pursuit, clear idea of fairness and justice and a healthy mind and physique.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it had only been in recent times, taken on to be synanomous with liberal arts- that is the learning of arts that do not pertain to direct application in Industries. Anything other than arts are meant to fit in jobs and be put to use in a practical manner. That is all education should be vocational, unless categorized as liberal arts. It had been the demand of the times, to fill up the jobs like bricks on a wall, leading to an education system that aims&nbsp;towards direct application of information rather than culturing and enriching an individual. But in recent times, that too is changing, some of the major industry leaders had commented the mismatch of skills of the graduates vis a vis real needs of business, the reason is not that the skills acquired in instituions are broad and generic but rather the oppossite. I do not deny there had been comments to the oppossition to this point as well, but many of us see, the way times are changing, particularly us teaching folks and parents. Gone are the days, when a teacher could throw a quick fact and be awed at by the students, now such clever one liner statistic would only invite a wry back bench whisper like 'this guy spends too much time hooked up to google'. &nbsp;This represents a groundbreaking shift in the way information is produced and consumed in modern times, there is plenty of readymade information available, what is lacking is the uniquely human skillset of critical reasoning, ethical understanding and aesthetic use of such information to build a society.</p>

In periods of change, narrow specialization condemns us to inflexibility--precisely what we do not need. We need the flexible intellectual tools to be problem solvers, to be able to continue learning over time." &mdash;David Kearns, Xerox, 2002</span></p>
<p>We intend to provide schools with more material on this, movement towards a liberal education. We intend to dispell the particular myth that it is superfluous and burdensome to the quicker learning of skills.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So we intend to improve the education system, by blowing onto it a breath of life. We intend to show how magical it is to learn, how thrilling it is teach and guide the students. Imagine yourself being &nbsp;a guide of a secret cave guiding newbie tourists. The thrills that comes with walking around those magnificient works of nature is awesome as much as enjoying the thrills you just created in the hearts of&nbsp;those witenessing it &nbsp;for the first time. The landscapes of knowledge can be as good and better with the media and the accumulated works of knowledge of humanity in this time and era. So lets teachers and students get the thrills of it and enjoy their way through it. Of course, lets also gamble in the competitive exams and lets no more gamble in the civil life that schools are preparing us - This means an 'educated' civil gentleman or lady that comes out of the school, complete to every detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
