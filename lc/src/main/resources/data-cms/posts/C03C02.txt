<p>A case for liberal education for parents:</p>
<p>We are going to deal with three aspects of parents role when it comes to schooling. These are rather at the back of their mind behind the gnawing fears of a outlook of an uncertain future of their children, however idealistic they become out of the education.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">To make sure children conduct their lives in harmony and peace by preserving the good portions of our culture.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">To make sure children enjoy education.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">To help children fare better economically.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary concerns are, very practically:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Why a civil involvement is so needed while most needs could be met at the community level.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Parents who&nbsp;had seen poverty would put economic prosperity of children above many other things, for practical reasons.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Children always have a tendency to experiment and waver off course, it is in the best interest that they be supplied a healthy dose of conservatism, so that they have more certainity and solidness in their lives. This is particularly relevant in that Indian past had always been marked with vagaries - of monsoons, of cyclones and of the general economy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We will address by collating the positives and negative arguments</p>
<p>First essay will look at whether the kids can have a happier and well rounded life if they were liberally educated.</p>
<p>Second one will look at whether children can fare better economically and in terms free choice unconstrained by economy.</p>
<p>Third one will look at the stability socially and&nbsp;personally.</p>
