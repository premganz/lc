<p class="MsoNormal">We are the leafy campus organization</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">We are one of the organizations that wants to change the world for better. That is a very generic agenda for a not a few NGOs spread across the world and here in India. They have added a lot of value to &nbsp;the progress of many developing societies - helping the downtrodden here, bringing awarenes of basic health care there and generally supplemented and sometimes inspired governmental and international agencies in real social progress. But the world as we see it today is still not completely free of problems, yet. &nbsp;Some of the problems that the world faces today are more difficult in that the problems are becoming more and more grey and systematic and less concrete &lsquo;eradication&rsquo; type. For instance it might be possible to step into a society with a problem with flooding and provide them with know how , generate initiatives to build inundation canals and even fund them. But what do we do with such problems as non sustainability - resources are getting stripped off leaving little to posteriety, a worseining distribution situation and a stagnant general happiness and life satisfaction of peoples, in spite of apparent progress because the incremental units of the concrete measures came with poor quality or with side effects.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">While sifting through the optimal solutions for these problems and quite some scientific evidence and a lot of anecdotal evidence points to problems in development of the human mind as being the drivers for many of the problems. One could trace down issues of insecurity, confusion and incoherence to many problems that manifest as manipulative exploitation of the underlying tenets of social cooperation, the proverbial queue cutters and free riders we encounter in societies more often in developing countries like India. Then there are people whose education did not help them understand the harmony and the gameliness of civilized life that they feel and insecurity and a compulsion to overachieve often at the cost to the environment and fellow humanity and significant disturbance to the equilibrium of the chain of distribution of resources. There are people whose lives were under enriched by tiresome loads of inconsequentially factual data leaving them frustrated, trapped and indifferent. It is evident that the earliest up-stream where we can catch these problems are at the level of schooling and pre university education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">There, this is not a a phenomenal discovery. In fact an established pillar of civilized life in the same ranks as rule of law, democracy and the scientific method is the institution of Universal Public Instruction. The intent of a comprehensive and lengthy education is enable humans to appreciate the complexities of civilized world and help them behave as good citizens of the world. However, this had frequently invited criticisms like &lsquo;making bricks on the wall&rsquo;. Well, there is a certain discomfort over an apparent imposition of conformity in the way modern curricula is designed, leading to frustrations as well. So we stand in a cross roads where education system does not want imposition and conformance to certain norms the majority holds dear on the day of education, which presumes that these are beyond challenge leading to natural frustration with the elders. Then there is a need for the education system to bring to light the nature of civilized living, an understanding of the the institutions and scientific discoveries made till date so that the individual is equipped for assuming a role that could add value to the overall journey of mankind towards better material living, better harmony with nature and achieving greater capacity for aesthetic appreciation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Then the education system should neither be too rigid nor be too blurry. It should provide scope for creativity and at the same time highlight with sharpness the tenets of human existence in civil life and define with clarity and exhaustiveness its various bodies of knowledge and how the breakthroughs in medicine and agriculture and engineering helped mankind to lead lives of lesser hostility with nature and among themselves. They need to understand and subscribe on merit and not on coercion to the civil life of the day, they should be assured that they could put their hands and change these for better and they should be actually convinced of and bought into the validity and goodness of the present bodies of knowledge.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">This in our opinion calls for a strong supplementation of current systems of education. While the current education system in fact goes strong on providing with the latest and accurate facts to the children, there is a missing old world charm in integrative learning, think of how stimulative experiential and integrative education in the Greek or the Victorian England. Of course this was reserved for the privilaged few, which was rather evil. But the spirit of the argument is the way in which education was appreciated and provided a clarity to the ones educated.&nbsp; We could by supplementing a stimulating scheme of workshops, lectures and prespective walk throughs probably recreate the educational completeness that with the current levels of scientific accuracy and never before levels of access to information &nbsp;make the scholar of the most interested and finely educated type.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">This, broadly, &nbsp;is our strategy to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Then we seek help from institutions, teachers and parents and fellow organizations to help us realize this, by running campaigns, model integrative programs and come up with studies and metrics and help us create documents capturing the schemes in concreteness and making it possible for wider adaptations.&nbsp;</p>
