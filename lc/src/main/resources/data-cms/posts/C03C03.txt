<p><strong>Liberal Education and better living</strong></p>
<p>Every Parent&nbsp;would want their kids to be secured in life after school, to do things that would help them lead decent lives as responsible citizens, to acquire wealth in conventional ways and to prosper. The idea of their kid going on to change the world or even to work in a world as a citizen of great quality, of gentlemanship are distant&nbsp;to the everyday parent and overshadowed by more practical concerns.</p>
<p>The reason in the Indian context is quite understandable. The average Indian does not want to change the way things work, smartness and getting ahead of the peers is valued rather than becoming philosophically inclined and moving over to the side and waving an overtake me sign decently. You would see even on narrow hill roads, it is rare to come across people who would move over to the kerb and wave you to pass. That is simply so against the Indian values. One has to remain on the road, because historically India had been a land of passive competition for limited resources. Here&nbsp;is one that has the most arable land in the world that&nbsp;had from times of Ashoka supported as many as a 100 million in popoulation. The nature of the forces of nature containing the population in India is unique, in that it is highly unpredictable. There are harsh environments with predictably low rainfall such as the Kalahari, &nbsp;predictably high disease burden like the Congo RainForests where it is easier for the population to adjust is comparitively simpler. But in a land where in a year there is plenty and another a monsoon failure or a flood or a disease outbreak, presents unique challenges.</p>
<p>The problem was then to do with diseases and famine and floods that gnarl things out of shape at random, which helped maintain the popoulation at a stable level till 1700s. Then one can imagine that this is going to be rough game, its crowded and every family wants to get ahead, there is little elbow room to experiment or fool around. It is like a crowded bus on a humid evening. The families and extended families, factions and castes were the units of social organization that helped regulate individual on a tight leash. Therefore beat the beaten track, make yourself prosperous along a known line, appreciated by the crowd, dont just go about calling yourself an accomplished linguistic scholar, but rather someone that your fragment of society knows and acknowledges. If you are traditionally from a vessel merchant family, open a bigger vessel store and likewise. That way you get to control the fundamental&nbsp;powerhouses of the Indian society- the extended family. The extended family exerts the most economic and social power and can put an Individual through great misery by disowning or rise him to great power as the head of the faction and if the faction is an dominant one, then it can help the head garner vast estates with impunity. The weight of his group about him. This is what happens in most situations, people want the students to rise and shine within the sphere of relevance of the community, the reason is that most of Indian people find security, not from a well functioning state, nor from a well established pan Indian tradition, nor from circles and societies of merits, but rather from their extended families and communities and hence staying relevant to that makes sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as I told, this comes at a cost of belittling the individual, the young man with flamboyant spirit who wants to go forth into the world, experience it in ifs fullness like Thoreau would say - "to find out if its good or its mean" he would only be promptly put down by the elders who actually echo the thoughts of the community. Well, lets be neutral and non judgemental as to whether a guarded conservative strategy is one of most expediency. But its our responsibility to look at the way things are going to come up in the future, looking for signs and red herrings. I see the rise of nuclear family, the rise of the urbanism and rise of western values as signs that we might break off from the community setup and move slowly into a more western valued society or some kind of a hybrid. There is also growing pressure from markets to break apart the joint family system where decisions are unpredictable and made on values that range from age old customs or simple prohibition by the elder member of the family. The individual's choices are more predictable and conducive to an analytics driven marketing and keeping the economy growing. Government policies too seem to incline in this direction. Besides the history of stagnation that came with a strong community level control, that gave rise to irrational disciminations, capping of potentials of individuals and rigidity of behaviour is bound to set as more and more individuals, starting the budding middle class of the 40s&nbsp;found the libertarian values of the colonial times inviting and much less boring. Then inevitably to keep pace with a world of increasing prosperity, one cannot still sell a stable and stagnated social organization, particularly after all the bad experience with casteism and superstitions. Then one must open up the family for a steadily libertarian outlook. Each one should be able to decide for himself, to a greater extent and rationally evaluate traditions on merits.</p>
<p>But one cannot expect absolute liberty and also hope to save&nbsp;the traditional and cultural forces from extinction. The idea is to have a social system that is stable as not to be swayed wildly by contradicting values across each generation, a generation of rationalist rebels and another of strong right wing conservatives alternating is inimical to a society that looks forward to enrichment and prosper. More needs to be on a middle ground by way of critical education, where individuals can look for rationalization of traditions and also let somethings stay put because culture and values doubtlessly also matter, afterall one does not look at a&nbsp;Monet&nbsp;to undertand it or value it on its utility. Aesthetic beauty of a december sunset, the charm of a familial get together are things even the rational of thinkers would not want to disturb by rational enquiry.&nbsp;The future of India is one of a libertarian youth, that learns newer skills, progresses in new ways, opens up new roads and immerses in wealth and this is happening at an astounding pace in India. There is already a lag of the older generation to realize this phase of change. They still find it imcomprehensible why the old&nbsp;joint homes in native villages&nbsp;holds no charm for their dispersed children. While they are at coming to terms with it, another&nbsp;phase&nbsp;of change has set in. The children at school now would come of age into a world of great mobility, minimal tradition and strong libertarian values that they might at some point of their lives start&nbsp;missing, though when its too late that their life is so&nbsp;anemic in the traditional and cultural factor . &nbsp;Then whatever had been left to decadance by them couple of decades ago, need to be adapted and repaired when they need it back, after being thrown around by whirlwind of computerization and consumerization of their lives.</p>
<p>In foresight, it is the duty of this generation of parents to so guide the children that they could appreciate culture and enjoy its aesthetics under the lens of&nbsp;critical&nbsp;examination wrought not just by an education that attunes them in seeking value addition to material things, but also which appreciates the connectedness of things. The critical faculties then need to be developed with such that they are able to appreciate aesthetics as much as they strip down systems analytically. The education that would enable an enriched society for that generation would then be a liberal one, which not just bundles up facts and delivers them to children, but rather shows how the world works and interprets it in the rich language of mathematics and sciences and humanities so that they grasp the underlying beauty of it all. They would then be in a position not only knowing how to reason but when to reason. Education can become a process of enjoyable enrichment of the mind, not just a means to an end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kind of children educated in an all round fashion hence can experience life as not simply as a compromize to attain the necessary riches, the idea of running a race as rendered in Chetan Bhagat's&nbsp;<em>five point some one.&nbsp;</em>They can then have a life that combines wealth, intelligence on material topics and an appreciation of such things as familial values, intellectual and artistic pursuits, strong friendships, cultural involvement. It is for the parents to build for their children, not just a legacy of a sponsored education but also a rich culture that had been inherited with appreciation. A person who attains material gains had only come half a way in his life, not discounting the half, afterall survivalism is of most importance in an Indian Context, but the other half of an intelligent human, a person who is not just smart in putting things together and making it do a few tricks, but one who can appreciate a symphony, a person who can look into the intricacies of nature through science and enjoy every moment of it and a person who would rise in society by harmonious relationship among his relatives and friends, be kind to nature and old and valid traditions had come the other half too. Beyond a critical point of acadamic and resultant financial success, the marginal utility of such accumulation nosedives and it is then people start searching for spiritual outlets to provide meaning to their lives. If we could add that degree of completeness in the education of a young person after of course equipping him for the economic line of life, to an extent where it is necessary and would have high marginal utility, one would definitely expect to see &nbsp;a more complete, harmonious and happier existence.</p>
