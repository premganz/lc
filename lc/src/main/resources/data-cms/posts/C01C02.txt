<h3>The Idea of 'having been educated'</h3>
<p>It is not uncommon in India*, to be met with certain kind of behaviour, such as someone cutting ahead in a queue or compromizing road manners to get a bit of an advantage over fellow road users. This kind of behaviour is often met with a exclamation of whether the offender had ever 'beeen educated'. I&nbsp;often happen to visit&nbsp;a big&nbsp;special economic zone complex in Chennai, where one could reasonably expect an average education level much higher than elsewhere in the city, but find the roads not much different, there were people who would not think twice to cut before you, well I am not expecting the most gentle manners of colonial tradition here, its just that basic manners that has practical advantages, like that we can get ahead on the road without a traffic jam. The way people blame on 'education', kind of seems unfair, after all, the guy is going to be rude and there is nothing schools can do with his personality, perhaps being aggressive is in his genes, perhaps it got into him because of a bad day at work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then, on second thoughts, after all we have been shaped more significantly than any other aspect of the society, by the institutionalized education. We spend most of our times there till we get on to to a job and for the majority of the healthier half of our lives, getting educated is our primary occupation. Then is education not expected to have a stronger impact in our personalities that these bad days and genetic temptations could not sway, atleast not so whimsically. Education in spirit is much more than equipping with skills needed for jobs to be performed, or break across artificial filters like entrance examinations, for the want of better means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This had been ranted&nbsp;over and over that it had gotten into our minds as too obvious to need any attention.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Well, forget the rant on traffic and queues, these are just nagging issues associated with living in an Indian city, but extrapolate it further, the guy who does not get along with an ordered system (of minimal constraints, no one expects disciplined automatons who do nothing more than directed), with appreciation of the beauty of it, goes on to head Corporations&nbsp;only to remorselessly pollute the atmosphere and lobby against green house gas emission control initiatives, may be run oppressive sweat shops or may be just become seized up with power that he might lead a country to a war. A good education can keep things on track, &nbsp;not as bricks on the wall, but as adventurous, decent citizens who play tough but never hit below the belt and who sees beauty in creating things, be it a space probe or nice building. Believe me being good is not as boring as it is projected to be, in most popular media. You get to do all the stuff you can do being bad, you can hang off from bus footboards, you can drop out of college and work on to a career in movies, just about everything, but being good is just that there is no 'collateral damage'.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">You understand and appreciate why doing something is important to you and you make sure no one who does not subscribe to the game is getting hurt as a result. You always go for motorcycle racing in a closed track with buddies who know the risks and never in the streets, where you might hurt some innocent guy returning home late from work. The idea is to play tough and play with equals, thats chivalry man, not&nbsp;being docile and bland plain good. The idea of a good education system is to make people, young people, see the difference, which is very tricky instead of the simplification we dealt with to the issue. We might call this the making of an 'educated man'. There are two things a student would need to see before he could attempt to become one:</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">1) Understand things in their wholeness, the way in which disciplines are connected and make sense towards creating things of enduring beauty, in physcial and intangible forms. To engage in creation of such things and stand apart and appreciate the beauty of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">2) To engage in friendship and culture that involves creativity, inquistiveness of things happening around us and more importantly chivalry, in games and work.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">This is more relevant in this point of time, because, we do not have any particular class of nobility to blame for what goes on in the world, corruption or corporate greed. Earlier all such powerful occupations are limited to inner circle of people to whom such roles were restricted. Now it is not the case, every corrupt politician, relentless industrial polluter all had araised, more often than not from among our humble streets, rising and getting on to positions of power and sorely missing education when they get to the top, and not knowing it. The result is a mess, we know of, though doubtless things are improving. So to clean up things for our children, we would need to turn around education, turn around to where it belonged, by defenition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;* Speaking objectively, there are many other things, I like India for.</span></p>
