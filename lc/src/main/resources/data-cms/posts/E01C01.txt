<p>We had given a fair idea of our purposes in the "About Us" Section.&nbsp;We intend to bring not a revolution, but a slow transformation in the way children are educated. We intend to build a tradition of solidness in education, as the chairman of AACU would like to say &nbsp;- "getting educated instead of learning subjects"forth a wide and deep education method, particularly but not limited to India (because we use the web medium). There had been a few initiatives in the field of liberal education in India as well, but that not in the mainstream. Mainstream is more about outcome oriented education. That is not that the latter is to be discounted, but rather than the former can be more effective in opening up the gates of imagination and critical thinking that is the need of the future. We are now in a phase where STEM education is worshipped as being relevant to the times, indeed, but there is an imperative to look beyond a decade or more in order to prepare pupils for the world they would go into.</p>
<p>To throw things in sharp contrast, I would like to draw attention to the way education functions in India, there had been quite some ranting by old timers and people having been exposed to a life in the west. People allege that the education system involves rote and stuffing facts into the heads of children with scarcely a thought on how this is going to become useful in a civil social life, how well the child is going to contribute towards better science, better medicine and most of all synergize his contribution with the needs of the society and his fellow citizens to create &nbsp;a happier, more peaceful (not necessarily boring non competitive) world. An even more contrasted image can be viewed by looking at the way children are trained to crack competitive exams for the limited seats in premier education institutions we have. Well, clamouring to get into sought after institutions is not bad per se, but the problem is more to do with the reality of the situation. We are trying to cram them thousands through the narrow gates to a promised heaven, full well knowing that it is a gamble. So I suggest why not gamble in the spirit of gambling, instead of being all worked up and sweating. I would not have said the same thing in the India 20 years ago, because opportunities outside of the salvation that knocks once after your schooling are very thin. But look around now, there had been a lot of progress made and there is not just one way to have a fulfilling productive life.</p>

<p>So we intend to improve the education system, by blowing onto it a breath of life. We intend to show how magical it is to learn, how thrilling it is teach and guide the students. Imagine yourself being &nbsp;a guide of a secret cave guiding newbie tourists. The thrills that comes with walking around those magnificient works of nature is awesome as much as enjoying the thrills you just created in the hearts of&nbsp;those witenessing it &nbsp;for the first time. The landscapes of knowledge can be as good and better with the media and the accumulated works of knowledge of humanity in this time and era. So lets teachers and students get the thrills of it and enjoy their way through it. Of course, lets also gamble in the competitive exams and lets no more gamble in the civil life that schools are preparing us - This means an 'educated' civil gentleman or lady that comes out of the school, complete to every detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
