<p>Featured Idea:</p>
<p>Pictured above is Jean-Jacques Rousseau.&nbsp;Rousseau was one of the eminent figures in the Enlightenment era of Europe. He is best remembered for his work Social Contract, but he also held some brilliant views on education documented in his book&nbsp;<em>Emile or On Education</em>. His idea had lasting imprints on thinkers of a wide assortment ranging from Karl Marx to Maria Montessouri. The gist of his idea was that humans are basically good and that there are inalienable rights to every human being that can only be waived by the person in exchange of a fair contract. His idea on education was not to use reasoning in imparting knowledge to students but to help students discover 'how to reason' properly by guided exploration.</p>
